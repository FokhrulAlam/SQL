Hi, now we will see how we can print a specific column, how we can order information etc. Please see the following code. We are
going to learn a whole lot of things.



DROP TABLE student;

CREATE TABLE student(
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(15),
    major VARCHAR(15),
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);

SELECT * FROM student;

SELECT major FROM student;

SELECT student_id,name FROM student;

SELECT student.name, student.major
FROM student;

SELECT student_id,major FROM student
ORDER BY major;

SELECT name,major FROM student
ORDER BY name DESC;

SELECT * FROM student
ORDER BY student_id DESC;

SELECT * FROM student
ORDER BY major ASC,student_id DESC;

SELECT * FROM student
LIMIT 2;

SELECT * FROM student
ORDER BY major
LIMIT 2;

SELECT * FROM student
WHERE major='EEE';

SELECT major,name FROM student
WHERE student_id>=4
ORDER BY student_id DESC
LIMIT 5;

SELECT * FROM student
WHERE name IN ('Mousumi','Mayabi','Minhaz');


INSERT INTO student(name,major) VALUES('Fokhrul','EEE');
INSERT INTO student(name,major) VALUES('Mrinal','EEE');
INSERT INTO student(name,major) VALUES('Rahima','BBA');
INSERT INTO student(name,major) VALUES('Mousumi','English');
INSERT INTO student(name,major) VALUES('Mayabi','Math');
INSERT INTO student(name,major) VALUES('Minhaz','IT');
