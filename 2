NOTE: Please see file no. 1 first. This is file no 2.

Here we will create the same table. But look at the code below. This code is not going to print the whole table.
    
 student_id |    name    |   major   
-------------+------------+----------
        5001 | Fokhrul    | EEE       
        5002 | Mrinal     | EEE       
        5005 | Rahima     | BBA       
        5006 | Mousumi    | English   
        5007 | Mayabi     | Math      
        5003 | Minhaz     | IT  


OUR CODE IS AS FOLLOWS:

DROP TABLE student;

CREATE TABLE student(
    student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    major VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE,
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);

SELECT * FROM student;

INSERT INTO student VALUES(5001,'Fokhrul','EEE');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(5002,'Mrinal','EEE');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(5003,'Rahima','BBA');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(5004,NULL,'English');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(5005,'Mayabi','Math');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(5006,'Minhaz','IT');



EXPLANATION: While creating the table, we put a condition for the column 'name' and it is "NOT NULL". For the column 'major', the 
condition is 'UNIQUE'. But, look! In the second row, the third column repeats that in the third column of first row. It means they
are not unique. So, Whichever of these two will get run first will work fine. The second one would show an erro such as 
"Duplicate Entry EEE for major". The fourth will not get executed because the column is NULL what it actually can not be.
