Hi everybody. From this file, we are going to create a company database. This file is part 1. We will create several tables for
the database.

####The following is the employee table-

CREATE TABLE employee(
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(40),
last_name VARCHAR(40),
birth_date DATE,
sex VARCHAR(1),
salary INT,
super_id INT,
branch_id INT
);

##### The following is the branch table. Here mgr_id is the emp_id of employee table.

CREATE TABLE branch(
branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
branch_name VARCHAR(40),
mgr_id INT,
mgr_start_date DATE,
FOREIGN KEY(mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

####Making super_id and branch_id of table employee, foreign keys.

ALTER TABLE employee
ADD FOREIGN KEY(branch_id)
REFERENCES branch(branch_id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE employee
ADD FOREIGN KEY(super_id)
REFERENCES employee(emp_id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

####The following is the client table.

CREATE TABLE client(
client_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
client_name VARCHAR(40),
branch_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY(branch_id) REFERENCES branch(branch_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

####Below is the works_with table.

CREATE TABLE works_with(
emp_id INT,
client_id INT,
total_sales INT,
PRIMARY KEY(emp_id,client_id),
FOREIGN KEY(emp_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
FOREIGN KEY(client_id) REFERENCES client(client_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

#### This is the final table of this company database. The table name is branch_supplier.

CREATE TABLE branch_supplier(
branch_id INT,
supplier_name VARCHAR(40),
supply_type VARCHAR(40),
PRIMARY KEY(branch_id,supplier_name),
FOREIGN KEY(branch_id) REFERENCES branch(branch_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

######There you go. We created all the tables for our database. This is the end of this file. In the next file we are going to 
insert information into the tables.
